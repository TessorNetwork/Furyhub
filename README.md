GRID network (a.k.a. GRIDnet) aims to establish a technology foundation to facilitate construction of next-generation distributed applications. By incorporating a comprehensive service infrastructure and an enhanced IBC protocol into the Tendermint & Cosmos stack, GRIDnet enables service interoperability as well as token transfers across an internet of blockchains.
As the centerpiece of GRIDnet, GRID Hub (a.k.a. GRIDhub) will be the first regional hub connecting to the main Cosmos Hub, thus making GRIDnet an inseparable part of the whole Cosmos network.
